function landscape(v)% LANDSCAPE(V) - Sets GCF to print the current figure in landscape orientation.%   If the vector V = [left_margin,bottom_margin,width,height] is specified %   (in inches), the figure will print on the corresponding part of the page. %   If V is not included, the full-page default is used: V = [0.5,0.5,10,7.5].%   The figure window is specified to occupy 640 (wide) by 480 (tall) pixels%   on the screen display. To avoid accidental resetting of properties (e.g.,%   within called functions), this command can be given at the end of the %   calling routine that produces the plot. Be sure that the Page Setup com-%   mand in the File menu is also set for the same orientation, prior to %   printing.if nargin<1;v=[.5,.5,10,7.5];endset(gcf,'PaperOrientation','landscape')set(gcf,'PaperPosition',v,'PaperUnits','inches');set(gcf,'Position',[50,100,640,480],'Units','pixels')orient landscape
