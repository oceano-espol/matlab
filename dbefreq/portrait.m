function portrait(v)
%function portrait(v)
% PORTRAIT Sets GCF to print the current figure in portrait orientation.
%
% If the vector V = [left_margin,bottom_margin,width,height] is specified 
% (in inches), the figure will print on the corresponding part of the page. 
% If V is not included, the full-page default is used: V = [0.5,0.5,7.5,10].
% The default figure window is specified to occupy 480 (wide) by 640 (tall) 
% pixels on the screen display. To avoid accidental resetting of properties 
% (e.g.,within called functions), this command can be given at the end of the 
% calling routine that produces the plot. Be sure that the Page Setup com-
% mand in the File menu is also set for the same orientation, prior to 
% printing. On specified V, the screen window is resized in proportion to V.
