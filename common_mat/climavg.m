function [anom,clim] = climavg(x,clim)%Function [Anom,Clim] = climavg(X,Clim) -- Climatology & anomalies by average-month %  method. For M time series (length N) arranged as the columns of X, computes %  the monthly climatology and residuals -- Clim and Anom -- by averaging each  %  successive month of the calendar year. Clim is returned as a 12-by-M matrix%  and Anom is returned as a matrix with dimensions N-by-M (same as X). The%  data (X) must begin in January. Correctly handles missing data coded as NaNs.%%  On input, Clim is optional. If present, it is assumed the user is provideing%  the climatology for computation of anomalies.%%  See also CLIMAVGN[n,m] = size(x);if n*m > 1000; cue=1; else; cue=0; end   % Monitor statusinc=12*(ceil(n/12)-n/12);x=[x' nan*ones(m,inc)]';[nr,nc]=size(x);nyrs=nr/12;if nargin == 1, clim = zeros(12,nc); endanom = zeros(12*nyrs,nc);if cue == 1; h = waitbar(0,'Executing...'); endfor k=1:nc	xx = reshape(x(:,k),12,nyrs)';	if nargin == 1, clim(:,k) = meanmiss(xx)'; end	anom(:,k) = x(:,k) - reshape(clim(:,k)*ones(1,nyrs),nr,1);	if cue == 1; waitbar(k/nc); endendanom(n+1:nr,:) = [];if cue == 1; close(h); end
