%Function [Anom,Clim] = climavg2(X) -- Climatology & anomalies by average-month 
%  method. For M time series (length N) arranged as the columns of X, computes 
%  the monthly climatology and residuals -- Clim and Anom -- by averaging each  
%  successive month of the calendar year. Clim is returned as a 12-by-M matrix
%  and Anom is returned as a matrix with dimensions N-by-M (same as X). The
%  data (X) must begin in January. Correctly handles missing data coded as NaNs.
